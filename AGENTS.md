# AGENTS.md

Agent guidance for the `@echecs/position` package — foundational chess position
type and board utilities in the `@echecs` family of chess libraries.

See the root `AGENTS.md` for workspace-wide conventions.

**Backlog:** tracked in
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/mormubis/position/issues).

## Project Overview

The foundational package. Provides the `Position` type (complete chess position
value object with `Map<Square, Piece>` board) and pure query functions. Internal
0x88 board representation lives in `src/internal/` and is exposed via the
`./internal` export condition for use by `@echecs/game`.

No runtime dependencies — keep it that way.

---

## Similar Libraries

Use these to cross-check output when testing:

- [`chess.js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chess.js) — includes board
  representation and position querying as part of its chess engine.
- [`chessops`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chessops) — TypeScript chess
  library with `Board`, `Setup`, and `Position` types using bitboards.

## Dependency Graph

```
@echecs/position     ← no runtime dependencies
     ↑
@echecs/fen          (uses Position type + parse/stringify FEN)
@echecs/san          (uses Position type + isAttacked for resolve)
@echecs/game         (reworked — uses Position at public boundary + ./internal for 0x88)
```

---

## Export Conditions

- `.` (main) — public API: types, square utilities, query functions, constants
- `./internal` — 0x88 board utilities for use by @echecs/game ONLY:
  `squareToIndex`, `indexToSquare`, `boardFromMap`, `ATTACKS`, `RAYS`,
  `PIECE_MASKS`, `DIFF_OFFSET`, `OFF_BOARD`

Do NOT use `./internal` in application code — it is an implementation detail.

## 0x88 Representation

Index formula: `index = (8 - rank) * 16 + file` where file: a=0..h=7, rank:
1-based.

- a8=0, b8=1, …, h8=7, a7=16, …, a1=112, h1=119
- Off-board check: `index & 0x88 !== 0` (one bitwise AND)
- Array size: 128 (64 valid squares + 64 off-board padding)

---

## Commands

```bash
pnpm build              # compile TypeScript → dist/
pnpm test               # run all tests
pnpm lint               # ESLint + tsc type-check
pnpm format             # Prettier
pnpm lint && pnpm test && pnpm build   # full pre-PR check
```

---

## Validation

Input validation is mostly provided by TypeScript's strict type system at
compile time. There is no runtime validation library — the type signatures
enforce correct usage. Do not add runtime type-checking guards (e.g. `typeof`
checks, assertion functions) unless there is an explicit trust boundary.

---

## Architecture Notes

- **ESM-only** — the package ships only ESM. Do not add a CJS build.
- All interface fields sorted alphabetically (sort-keys ESLint error).
- Use `.js` extensions on all relative imports (NodeNext resolution).
- No null — use undefined everywhere (unicorn/no-null).
- `Position` is immutable by convention — query functions return new objects.

---

## Release Protocol

Step-by-step process for releasing a new version. CI auto-publishes to npm when
`version` in `package.json` changes on `main`.

1. **Verify the package is clean:**

   ```bash
   pnpm lint && pnpm test && pnpm build
   ```

   Do not proceed if any step fails.

2. **Decide the semver level:**
   - `patch` — bug fixes, internal refactors with no API change
   - `minor` — new features, new exports, non-breaking additions
   - `major` — breaking changes to the public API

3. **Update `CHANGELOG.md`** following
   [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com) format:

   ```markdown
   ## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD

   ### Added

   - …

   ### Changed

   - …

   ### Fixed

   - …

   ### Removed

   - …
   ```

   Include only sections that apply. Use past tense.

4. **Update `README.md`** if the release introduces new public API, changes
   usage examples, or deprecates/removes existing features.

5. **Bump the version:**

   ```bash
   npm version <major|minor|patch> --no-git-tag-version
   ```

6. **Commit and push:**

   ```bash
   git add package.json CHANGELOG.md README.md
   git commit -m "release: @echecs/position@x.y.z"
   git push
   ```

7. **CI takes over:** GitHub Actions detects the version bump, runs format →
   lint → test, and publishes to npm.

Do not manually publish with `npm publish`.
